# Multi-Asset Portfolio Management – Practical Demonstration

This notebook is the main entry point of the repository.

The objective is not to build sophisticated models,
but to illustrate how a multi-asset portfolio can be monitored, analysed,
and rebalanced using simple and transparent assumptions.

The analysis is written from the perspective of a junior asset management analyst,
focusing on portfolio behaviour, risk exposure, and allocation discipline.

## How to read this notebook

Each section corresponds to a small, self-contained project:
- portfolio monitoring
- risk metrics
- quantitative tools (Monte Carlo / Black–Scholes)
- rebalancing logic
- alternatives and private equity-style monitoring

The goal is not to run everything blindly,
but to understand what each tool is meant to illustrate
and what its limitations are.

## Setup

The notebook relies on simple Python scripts located in the `scripts/` folder.
They are imported and used as building blocks throughout the analysis.

All data is simulated for educational purposes.

import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Allow imports from the scripts folder
sys.path.append(str(Path("scripts").resolve()))

## 1. Portfolio monitoring

We start with a simple multi-asset portfolio composed of:
- Equities
- Bonds
- Alternatives

The objective here is not performance,
but to observe how the portfolio behaves through time:
growth, volatility, and drawdowns.

# Running the portfolio monitoring script
%run scripts/project1_portfolio_monitoring.py

## 2. Risk metrics

Returns alone do not describe risk.
Here we focus on a small set of intuitive indicators:
volatility, Value at Risk, and Expected Shortfall.

The purpose is to understand downside risk,
not to produce a regulatory-grade risk report.

%run scripts/project2_risk_metrics.py

## 3. Quantitative tools as analytical support

Quantitative models are used here as tools to build intuition,
not as black boxes.

We compare a Black–Scholes reference price
with a Monte Carlo estimate to illustrate uncertainty
and sensitivity to assumptions.

%run scripts/project3_monte_carlo_black_scholes.py

## 4. Rebalancing and allocation discipline

Rebalancing is a core part of portfolio management.
It helps control risk and prevents excessive concentration,
but it also generates turnover and transaction costs.

This section compares buy-and-hold with monthly rebalancing.

%run scripts/project4_rebalancing_simulation.py

## 5. Alternatives and private equity-style monitoring

Alternative assets require a different type of monitoring.
Instead of daily prices, we focus on cash flows,
residual value, and fund-level multiples.

This section illustrates basic PE-style metrics
within a diversified portfolio context.

%run scripts/project5_fund_monitoring_private_equity.py

## Conclusion

This notebook brings together several simple tools
commonly used in asset management.

None of the models presented here are meant to be predictive.
Their value lies in helping structure thinking,
interpret portfolio behaviour,
and support investment decisions with clarity and discipline.
